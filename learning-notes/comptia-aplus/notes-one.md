    - Use a shipping truck 
- The network topology is the roat 
    - Ethernet, DSL, cable system 
- The truck is the Internet Protocol (IP) 
    - We've designed the roads for this truck 
- The boxes hold your data 
    - Boxes of TCP and UDP 
- Inside the boxes are more things 
    - Application information 
### IP - Internet Protocol 
- | Ethernet Header | IP | TCP |    HTTP data    | Ethernet Trailer | 
### TCP and UDP 
- Transported inside of IP 
    - Encapsulated by the IP protocol 
- Two ways to move data from place to place 
    - Different features for different applications 
- OSI Layer 4 
    - The transport layer 
- Multiplexing 
    - Use many different applications at the same time 
    - TCP and UDP 
### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) 
- Connection-oriented 
    - A formal connection setup and close 
- "Reliable" delivery 
    - Recovery from errors 
    - Can manage out-of-order messages or retransmissions
- Flow control 
    - The receiver can manage how much data is sent
### UDP (User Datagram Protocol) 
- Connectionless 
    - No formal open or close to the connection 
- "Unreliable" delivery 
    - No error recovery 
    - No reordering of data or retransmissions 
- No flow control 
    - Sender determines the amount of data transmitted 
### Why would you ever use UDP? 
- Real-time communication 
    - There's no way to stop and resend the data 
    - Time doesn't stop for your network 
- Connectionless protocols 
    - DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) 
    - TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) 
- The data might not get through 
    - The application keeps track and devides what to do 
    - It might not to anything g
### Communication using TCP 
- Connection-oriented protocol prefer a "return receipt"
    - HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) 
    - SSH (Secure Shell)

- Ephemeral ports - temporary port numbers 
    - Ports 1,024 through 65,535
    - Determined in real-time by the client 
### Port numbers 
- TCP and UDP ports can be any number between 0 and 65,535 
- Most servers (services) use non-ephemeral(not-temporary) port numbers 
    - This isn't always the case 
        - It's just a number 
- Port numbers are for communication, not security 
- Service port numbers need to be "well known" 
- TCP port numbers aren't the same as UDP port numbers 
### Ports on the network 
- Web server - tcp/80
    - Source IP = 10.0.0.1 Dest IP = 10.0.0.2 | TCP Source Port = 3000 TCP Dest Port = 80 | HTTP data

## IPv4 and IPv6 2.5 
### IP addressing 
- IPv4 is the primary protocol for everything we do
    - Included in almost all configurations
- IPv6 is now part of all major operating systems
    - And the backbone of our Internet infrastructure
### IPv4 addresses 
- Internet Protocol version 4
    - OSI Layer 3 address
 
| 192      | 168      | 1        | 131      |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 11000000 | 10101000 | 00000001 | 10000011 | 

- 1 octet = 1 byte = 8 bits
- 32 bits = 4 bytes
### IPv6 addresses 
- Internet Protocol v6 - 128-bit address
    - 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses (340 undecillion)
    - 6.8 billion people coul have 5,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

| fe80             | 0000             | 0000             | 0000             | 5d18             | 0652             | cffd             | 8f52             |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 1111111010000000 | 0000000000000000 | 0000000000000000 | 0000000000000000 | 0101110100011000 | 0000011001010010 | 1100111111111101 | 1000111101010010 | 

- 2 octets = 2 bytes = 16 bits
- 128 bits = 16 bytes
- Your DNS is very important !
- First 64 bits is generally the network prefix (/64)
- Last 64 bits is then the host network address
### Networking with IPv4 
- IP Address, e.g., 192.168.1.165
    - Every device needs a unique IP address
- Subnet mask, e.g., 255.255.255.0
    - Used by the local device to determine what subnet it's on
        - The subnet mask isn't (usually) transmitted across the network
        - You'll ask for the subnet mask all the time
            - What's the subnet mask of this network?
- Default gateway, e.g., 192.168.1.1
    - The router that allows you to communicate outside of your local subnet
    - The default gateway must be an IP address on the local subnet
### DNS server 
- We remember names
    - professormesser.com, google.com, youtube.com
- Internet routers don't know names
    - Routers only know IP addresses
- Something has to translate between names and IP addresses
    - Domain Name Services
- You configure **two** DNS servers in your IP configuration
    - That's how important it is
## Assigning IP Addresses 2.5
### DHCP 
- IPv4 address configuration used to be manual
    - IP address, subnet mask, gateway, DNS servers, NTP servers, etc.
- October 1993 - The bootstrap protocol
    - BOOTP
- BOOTP didn't automatically define everything
    - Some manual configurations were still required
    - BOOTP also didn't know when an IP address might be abailable again
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
    - Initially released in 1997, updated through the years
    - Provides automatic address / IP configuration for almost all devices
### DHCP process 
- DORA
    - A four-step process
- Discover
    - Find a DHCP server
- Offer
    - Get an offer
- Request
    - Lock in the offer
- Acknowledge
    - DHCP server confirmation
### Discover
- The client sends a DHCPDISCOVER message to find available DHCP servers.
### Offer
- The DHCP server responds with a DHCPOFFER message, offering an available IP address.
### Request
- The client sends a DHCPREQUEST message to accept the offered IP address.
### Acknowledge
- The DHCP server sends a DHCPACK message to confirm and finalize the lease.
### Turning dynamic into static 
- DHCP assigns an IP address from the first available from a large pool of addresses
    - Your IP address will occasionally change
- You may not want your IP address to change
    - Server, printer, or personal preference
- Disable DHCP on the device
    - Configure the IP address information manually
    - Requires additional administration
- Better: Configure an IP reservation on the DHCP server
    - Associate a specific MAC address with an IP address
### Avoid manual configurations 
- No DHCP server reservation
    - You configure the IP address manually
- Difficult to change later
    - You must visit the device again
- A DHCP reservation is preferable
    - Change the IP address from the DHCP server
### Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) 
- A link-local address
    - No forwarding by routers
- IETF has reserved 169.254.0.0 through 169.254.255.255
    - First and last 254 addresses are reserved
    - Functional block of 169.254.1.0 through 169.254.254.255
- Automatically assigned
    - Uses ARP to confirm the address isn't currently in use 
## DNS Configuration 2.6
### Domain Name System 
- Translates human-readable names into computer-readable IP addresses
    - You only need to remember www.ProfessorMesser.com
- Hierarchical
    - Follow the path
- Distributed database
    - Many DNS servers
    - 13 root server clusters (Over 1,000 actual servers)
    - Hundreds of generic top-level domains (gTLDs) - .com, .org, .net, etc.
    - Over 275 country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) - .us, .ca, .uk, etc.
### The DNS hierarchy 
- . (dot) (Top-Level Domains TLDs) 
    - .com
        - .professormesser
            - www
            - live

                - ethan
                - judy
    - .net
    - .edu
    - .org
### DNS lookup 
```bash
dig www.professormesser.com
``` 
or 
```powershell
nslookup www.professormesser.com
```
### DNS records 
- Resource Records (RR)
    - The database records of domain name services
- Over 30 record types
    - IP addresses, certificates, host alias names, etc.
- These are important and critical configurations
    - Make sure to check your settings, backup, and test!
### DNS configuration 
- You can edit either a txt file with the config or the GUI in the browser 
### Address records (A) (AAAA) 
- Defines the IP address of a host
    - This is the most popular query
- A records are for IPv4 addresses
    - Modify the A record to change the host name to IP address resolution
- AAAA records are for IPv6 addresses
    - The same DNS server, different records
- www.professormesser.com. IN A 162.159.246.164 ; Professor Messer
### Mail exchanger record (MX) 
- Determines the host name for the mail server
    - This isn't an IP address; it's a name
### Text records (TXT) 
- Human-readable text information
    - Useful public information
    - Was originally designed for informal information
- Can be used for verification purposes
    - If you have access to the DNS, then you must be the administrator of the domain name
- Commonly used for email security
    - External email servers validate information from your DNS
### Sender Policy Framework (SPF) 
- SPF protocol
    - A list of all servers authorized to send emails for this domain
    - Prevent mail spoofing
    - Mail servers perform a check to see if incofming mail really did come from an authorized host
### Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) 
- Digitally sign a dommain's outgoing mail
    - Validated by mail servers, not usually seen by the end user
    - The public key is in the DKIM TXT record
### DMARC 
- Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)
    - Prevent unauthorized email use (spoofing)
    - An extension of SPF and DKIM
- You decide what external email servers should do with emails that don't validate through SPF or DKIM
    - That policy is written into a DMARC TXT record
    - Accept all, send to spam, or reject the email
    - Compliance reports can be sent to the email administrator
## DHCP Configuration 
### Scope Properties 
- IP address range
    - And excluded addresses
- Subnet mask
- Lease durations
- Other scope options
    - DNS server
    - Default gateway
    - VOIP servers
### DHCP pools 
- Grouping of IP addresses
    - Each subnet has its own scope
    - 192.168.1.0/24
    - 192.168.2.0/24
    - 192.168.3.0/24
    - ...
- A scope is generally a single contiguous pool of IP addresses
    - DHCP exceptions can be made inside of the scope
### DHCP address assignment
- Dynamic assignment

### RAID 0 - Striping
```
+-----------+-----------+
|  Disk 1   |  Disk 2   |
+-----------+-----------+
| Block A1  | Block A2  |
| Block B1  | Block B2  |
| Block C1  | Block C2  |
+-----------+-----------+
```

- File blocks are split between two or more physical drives
- High performance
    - Data written quickly
- No redundancy
    - A drive failure breaks the array
    - Raid 0 is zero redundancy
 ### RAID 1 - Mirroring
 ```
+-----------+-----------+
|  Disk 1   |  Disk 2   |
+-----------+-----------+
| Block A1  | Block A1  |
| Block B1  | Block B1  |
| Block C1  | Block C1  |
+-----------+-----------+
```


- File blocks are duplicated between two or more physical drives 
- High disk utilization 
    - Every file is duplicated
    - Required disk space is doubled
- High redundancy 
    - Drive failure does not affect data availability
### RAID 5 - Striping with parity
```
+-------------+------------+------------+
|  Disk 1     |  Disk 2    |  Disk 3    |
+-------------+------------+------------+
|  Block 1A   |  Block 2A  |  Parity A  |
|  Block 1B   |  Parity B  |  Block 2B  |
|  Parity C   |  Block 1C  |  Block 2C  |
+-------------+------------+------------+
```

- File blocks are striped
    - Along with a parity block
    - Requires at least three disks
- Efficient use of disk space
    - Files aren't duplicated, but space is still used for parity
- High redundancy
    - Data is available after drive failure
    - Parity calculation may affect performance
### RAID 10 (1+0) - A stripe of mirrors
```
           RAID 10 (RAID 1 + 0)

             +----------------+
             |    RAID 0     |
             | (striping)    |
             +-------+--------+
                     |
        +------------+------------+
        |                         |
   +----+----+              +----+----+
   | RAID 1  |              | RAID 1  |
   | Mirror  |              | Mirror  |
   +----+----+              +----+----+
        |                         |
  +-----+-----+             +-----+-----+
  | Disk 1    |             | Disk 3    |
  | Disk 2    |             | Disk 4    |
  +-----------+             +-----------+  
```
