- Memory used in laptops and mobile devices 
    - Often easy to install and replace 
- Some laptop memory is soldered to the system board 
    - No upgrade available 
    - Requires a full system board replacement 
### Laptop storage 
- Magnetic disk 
    - Traditional spinning drive platters 
    - 2.5 form factors (3.5 inch for desktops)

    - Two screws and the drive slides out 
- M.2 drives are even easier 
    - One screw 
    - Similar to RAM installation 
### Migrating from HDD to SSD 
- An impressive upgrade 
    - Move from spinning mechanical drive to solid state memory 
    - It's almost like getting a new laptop 
- Install an OS on the SSD 
    - Move user documents between drives 
    - Install any required applications 
    - Can be time consuming 
- Image/clone the HDD 
    - No OS installation required 
    - Move everything from one to the other 
- Imaging software needed 
    - Sometimes included with the SSD 
    - Many commercial and open source options 
- Create an image file 
    - One drive at a time 
- Drive-to-drive image 
    - Image directly from one drive to the other 
### 802.11 wireless and Bluetooth 
- Wireless network connectivity
    - Connect without wires 
- 802.11 
    - Local area network (LAN) 
    - High speed 
    - Internet access 
- Bluetooth 
    - Personal area network (PAN) 
    - Short range 
    - Connect peripherals and other nearby devices 
### Biometrics 
- Sign in or unlock your laptop with a fingerprint reader or face recognition
    - Something you are 
- Requires additional configuration in the OS 
    - Hardware required for most options 
- Relatively secure 
    - Faces and fingerprints are quite unique 
### Near-field communication (NFC) 
- Short-distance networking 
    - 4 centimeters or less 
    - Data transfers or authentication
- Common on mobile phones and smart watches 
    - Payment method on your wrist 
- Use it for authentication without typing a password 
    - Hospital workstations 
    - Warehouses 
    - Manufacturing 
## Laptop Displays
### Portable LCD 
- Liquid crystal display 
    - Light shines through liquid crystals 
- Advantages✅
    - Lightweight 
    - Relatively low power 
    - Relatively inexpensive 
- Disadvantages❌
    - Black levels are a challenge 
    - Requires seperate backlight 
        - Florescent, LED, etc
        - Lights are difficult to replace 
### LCD Technologies 
- TN (Twisted Nematic) LCD 
    - The original LCD technology 
    - Fast response times (gaming!) 
    - Poor viewing angles - color shifts 
- IPS (In Plane Switching) LCD 
    - Excellent color representation
    - More expensive to produce than TN 
- VA (Vertical Alignment) LCD 
    - A good compromise between TN and IPS 
    - Good color representation 
    - Slower response times than TN 
### OLED 
- Organic Light Emitting Diode 
    - Organic compound emits light when receiving an electric current 
- Thinner and lighter 
    - Flexible and mobile - no glass needed 
- No backlight 
    - The organic compound provides the light 
- Tablets, phones, smart watches 
    - Very accurate color representation 
    - A bit higher cost than LCD 
### Wi-Fi antennas 
- Multiple antennas 
    - WiFi main and aux 
    - Bluetooth 
- Antenna wires wrap around the laptop screen 
    - It's up high! 
### Webcam 
- Video capture 
    - Built-in camera and microphone 
- Usually includes both audio and video 
    - Specialized drivers and software 
### Microphone 
- Built-in to the laptop display 
    - Useful for video calls 
- Not good for non-casual use 
    - Analog or USB microphones can help 
### Fluorescent vs LED backlighting
- CCFL - Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp 
    - Higher voltage and power needed 
    - Added thickness to the display
    - No longer a common backlight
    - Older laptops will use these 
- LED- backlit LCD display
    - Backlight is LEDs instead of florescent
    - LEDs around the edge of the screen 
    - An array of LEDs behind the screen 
    - The latest laptops are LED-backlit 
### Backlight and inverter 
- LCD displays need a backlight 
    - Florescent lamp/LED to LCD display to your eyes 
- Some laptops have inverters 
    - Turn DC into AC 
- Verify backlight 
    - Look closely 
    - Use a flashlight 
- May need to replace the LCD inverter or display 
    - Choose carefully 
### Digitizer 
- Use a pen-like device as input 
    - Stylus input 
    - Useful for graphical input 
- Used commonly on laptop/tablets 
    - Or hybrid devices 
### Touchscreen 
- Merge laptop and tablet input 
    - Digitizer responds to touch 
    - No keyboard required 
    - But often still available 
- Many options for input 
    - Use the best one for the job
