# CompTIA A+ Notes One
## Laptop Hardware 
- Engineered to precise specifications 
    - A challenging repair 
- Some laptops are easier to fix than others 
    - An ongoing learning process 
- Understand the process 
    - The details will vary between laptop manufacturers 
### Laptop batteries 
- The power source when unplugged 
    - May be easily replace or require a teardown
    - Five minutes vs one hour 
- Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) and Lithium-Ion polymer (LiPo) are common 
    - No "memory effect"
    - Charging the battery diminishes capacity 
- Different form factor for each laptop 
    - Battery types and styles can vary 
    - Battery technology is changing constantly 
### Laptop keyboard 
- The most-used component of the laptop 
    - Can be easy to replace 
    - A few screws and a single ribbon cable 
    - May not always be this simple 
- Or connect an external USB keyboard 
    - Not very portable, but works in a pinch 
### Laptop keys 
- Some repairs might require the removal or replacement of a key cap 
    - This can be a delicate procedure 
- Check with the manufacturer's instructions 
    - It's very easy to accidentally break the key cap or the components underneath 
### Laptop memory
- Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module (SO-DIMM) 
- Memory used in laptops and mobile devices 
    - Often easy to install and replace 
- Some laptop memory is soldered to the system board 
    - No upgrade available 
    - Requires a full system board replacement 
### Laptop storage 
- Magnetic disk 
    - Traditional spinning drive platters 
    - 2.5 form factors (3.5 inch for desktops) 
- SSD (Solid-state drive) 
    - All memory, no moving parts 
    - Silent, fast access time, less latency
    - 2.5 inch form factors 
- M.2 
    - Smaller form factor 
    - No SATA data or power cables 
    - Easy to install and replace
### Replacing laptop storage 
- All internal 
    - Open a cover on the back 
    - Open the entire laptop 
- Can be very modular 
    - Two screws and the drive slides out 
- M.2 drives are even easier 
    - One screw 
    - Similar to RAM installation 
### Migrating from HDD to SSD 
- An impressive upgrade 
    - Move from spinning mechanical drive to solid state memory 
    - It's almost like getting a new laptop 
- Install an OS on the SSD 
    - Move user documents between drives 
    - Install any required applications 
    - Can be time consuming 
- Image/clone the HDD 
    - No OS installation required 
    - Move everything from one to the other 
- Imaging software needed 
    - Sometimes included with the SSD 
    - Many commercial and open source options 
- Create an image file 
    - One drive at a time 
- Drive-to-drive image 
    - Image directly from one drive to the other 
### 802.11 wireless and Bluetooth 
- Wireless network connectivity
    - Connect without wires 
- 802.11 
    - Local area network (LAN) 
    - High speed 
    - Internet access 
- Bluetooth 
    - Personal area network (PAN) 
    - Short range 
    - Connect peripherals and other nearby devices 
### Biometrics 
- Sign in or unlock your laptop with a fingerprint reader or face recognition
    - Something you are 
- Requires additional configuration in the OS 
    - Hardware required for most options 
- Relatively secure 
    - Faces and fingerprints are quite unique 
### Near-field communication (NFC) 
- Short-distance networking 
    - 4 centimeters or less 
    - Data transfers or authentication
- Common on mobile phones and smart watches 
    - Payment method on your wrist 
- Use it for authentication without typing a password 
    - Hospital workstations 
    - Warehouses 
    - Manufacturing 
## Laptop Displays
### Portable LCD 
- Liquid crystal display 
    - Light shines through liquid crystals 
- Advantages✅
    - Lightweight 
    - Relatively low power 
    - Relatively inexpensive 
- Disadvantages❌
    - Black levels are a challenge 
    - Requires seperate backlight 
        - Florescent, LED, etc
        - Lights are difficult to replace
