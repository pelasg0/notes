## Introduction to IP 2.1 
### A series of moving vans 
- Efficiently move large amounts of data 
    - Use a shipping truck 
- The network topology is the roat 
    - Ethernet, DSL, cable system 
- The truck is the Internet Protocol (IP) 
    - We've designed the roads for this truck 
- The boxes hold your data 
    - Boxes of TCP and UDP 
- Inside the boxes are more things 
    - Application information 
### IP - Internet Protocol 
- | Ethernet Header | IP | TCP |    HTTP data    | Ethernet Trailer | 
### TCP and UDP 
- Transported inside of IP 
    - Encapsulated by the IP protocol 
- Two ways to move data from place to place 
    - Different features for different applications 
- OSI Layer 4 
    - The transport layer 
- Multiplexing 
    - Use many different applications at the same time 
    - TCP and UDP 
### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) 
- Connection-oriented 
    - A formal connection setup and close 
- "Reliable" delivery 
    - Recovery from errors 
    - Can manage out-of-order messages or retransmissions
- Flow control 
    - The receiver can manage how much data is sent
### UDP (User Datagram Protocol) 
- Connectionless 
    - No formal open or close to the connection 
- "Unreliable" delivery 
    - No error recovery 
    - No reordering of data or retransmissions 
- No flow control 
    - Sender determines the amount of data transmitted 
### Why would you ever use UDP? 
- Real-time communication 
    - There's no way to stop and resend the data 
    - Time doesn't stop for your network 
- Connectionless protocols 
    - DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) 
    - TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) 
- The data might not get through 
    - The application keeps track and devides what to do 
    - It might not to anything g
### Communication using TCP 
- Connection-oriented protocol prefer a "return receipt"
    - HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) 
    - SSH (Secure Shell) 
- The application doesn't worry about out of order frames or missing data 
    - TCP handles all of the communication overhead 
    - The application has one job 
### Speedy delivery (example) 
- The IP delivery truck delivers from one (IP) address to another (IP) address 
    - Every house has an address, every computer has an IP address 
- Boxes arrive at the house / IP address 
    - Where do the boxes go? 
    - Each box has a room name 
- Port is written on the outside of the box 
    - Drop the box into the right room 
### List of ports 
- IPv4 sockets 
    - Server IP address, protocol, server application port number 
    - Client IP address, protocol, client port number 
- Non-ephemeral pors - permanent port numbers 
    - Port 0 through 1,023 
    - Usually on a server or service 
- Ephemeral ports - temporary port numbers 
    - Ports 1,024 through 65,535
    - Determined in real-time by the client 
### Port numbers 
- TCP and UDP ports can be any number between 0 and 65,535 
- Most servers (services) use non-ephemeral(not-temporary) port numbers 
    - This isn't always the case 
        - It's just a number 
- Port numbers are for communication, not security 
- Service port numbers need to be "well known" 
- TCP port numbers aren't the same as UDP port numbers 
### Ports on the network 
- Web server - tcp/80
    - Source IP = 10.0.0.1 Dest IP = 10.0.0.2 | TCP Source Port = 3000 TCP Dest Port = 80 | HTTP data 
- VoIP server - udp/5004 
    - Source IP = 10.0.0.1 Dest IP = 10.0.0.2 | UDP Source Port = 7100 UDP Dest Port = 5004 | VoIP data 
- Email server - tcp/143  
    - Source IP = 10.0.0.1 Dest IP = 10.0.0.2 | TCP Source Port = 4407 TCP Dest Port = 143 | Email data

- Runs from desks are made once
    - Permanently punched down to patch panel
- Patch panel to switch can be easily changed
    - No special tools
    - Use existing cables
### Firewalls 
- Filters traffic by port number
    - OSI layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
        - Some firewalls can filter based on the application
- Can encrypt traffic into/out of the network
    - Protect your traffic between sites
- Can proxy traffic
    - A common security technique
- Most firewalls can be layer 3 devices (routers)
    - Usually sits on the ingress/egress of the network
### Power over Ethernet (PoE) 
- Power provided on an Ethernet cable
    - One wire for both network and electricity
    - Phones, cameras, wireless access points
    - Useful in difficult-to-power areas
- Power provided at the switch
    - Built-in power - Endspans
    - In-line power injector - Midspans
### PoE switch
- Power over Ethernet
    - Commonly marked on the switch or interface
### Poe, Poe+, PoE++ 
- PoE: IEEE 802.3af-2003
    - The original PoE specification
    - Now part of the 802.3 standard
    - 15.4 watts DC power, 350 mA max current
- PoE+: IEEE 802.3at-2009
    - Now also part of the 802.3 standard
    - 25.5 watts DC power, 600 mA max current
- PoE++: IEEE 802.3bt-2018
    - 51 W (Type3), 600 mA max current
    - 71.3 W (Type4), 960 mA max current
    - PoE with 10GBASE-T
### Hub 
- "Multi-port repeater"
    - Traffic going in one port is repeated to every other port
- Everything is half-duplex
- Becomes less efficient as network traffic increases
- 10 megabit / 100 megabit
- Difficult to find today
### Cable modem
- Broadband
    - Transmission across multiple frequencies
    - Different traffic types
- Data on the "cable" network
    - DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification)
- High-speed networking
    - Speeds up to 1 Gigabit/s are available
- Multiple services
    - Data, voice, video
### DSL modem 
- ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)
    - Uses telephone lines
- Download speed is faster than the upload speed (asymmetric)
    - ˜10,000 foot limitation from the central office (CO)
    - 52 Mbit/s downstream / 16 Mbit/s upstream are common
    - Faster speeds may be possible if closer to the CO
### ONT 
- Optical network terminal
    - Fiber to the premises
- Connect the ISP fiber network to the copper network
    - Demarcation point (demarc) in the data center
    - Terminal box on the side of the building
- Line of responsibility
    - One side of the box is the ISP
    - Other side of the box is your network
### Network Interface Card (NIC) 
- The fundamental network device
    - Every device on the network has a NIC
    - Computers, servers, printers, routers, switches, phones, tablets, cameras, etc
- Specific to the network type
    - Ethernet, WAN, wireless, etc
- Often built-in to the motherboard
    - Or added as an expansion card
- Many options
    - Single port, multi-port, copper, fiber
