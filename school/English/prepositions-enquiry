Enquiry about/for Notebooks

We saw your advertisement about/on notebooks in the latest issue of Business Traveller magazine.

Our company is a fast-growing distributor of paints and coatings with an extensive sales network in Germany and the Netherlands. We are currently in the process of equipping our sales force with new notebooks and are therefore interested in your Travel Ace range.

Could you please supply us with detailed descriptions of the products in this range together with your current price list?

Full details of your terms of delivery and payment would also be appreciated. Since we are thinking of buying 50 notebooks, would you be willing to grant a quantity discount? 
In addition, we would be grateful for information on your current delivery period, as we need the notebooks by the end of next month.

Thank you for your attention to our enquiry.
We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,
